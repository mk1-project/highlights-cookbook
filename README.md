# Highlights API: Enhanced Retrieval Powered by our Custom LLM

Retrieval is crucial for tasks like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), document search, Q&A, and citation identification. However traditional methods like embedding-based semantic search struggle with retrieval accuracy, especially for nuanced or complex text.

To address these limitations, we've developed a **specialized LLM optimized specifically for retrieval**. We think of it as an "automatic highlighter," pinpointing key text segments directly within documents using the power of an LLM. It supports context windows **up to 2M tokens**, processes 32K tokens in fractions of a second, and achieves significantly higher accuracy compared to traditional retrieval methods.

Our Highlights API provides direct access to the model, which can be used:

- In isolation as a pure retrieval tool (e.g., to identify references in large documents).

- Coupled with another LLM for generation tasks, such as in RAG workflows.

- As a memory subsystem in complex agent workflows.

### Example Use Cases:

- ðŸš€ **Improve RAG:** Query massive documents (up to 2M tokens) using Highlights and feed results into an LLM for generation.

- ðŸŽ¯ **Reduce hallucinations:** Ground LLM responses with explicit citations.

- ðŸ’° **Reduce prompt size:** Distill lengthy prompts and minimize token costs with minimal impact.

- ðŸ§  **Flexible memory:** Provide agents access to queryable memory modules for complex workflows.
