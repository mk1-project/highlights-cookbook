      "   - Spontaneous Mutations: Occur naturally without intentional exposure to a mutagen.\n",
      "   - Induced Mutations: Caused by mutagens, such as chemicals or radiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Rate or Frequency of Occurrence**:\n",
      "   - Rare Mutations: Occur infrequently in populations and are usually recessive.\n",
      "   - Recurrent Mutations: Occur repeatedly and can potentially change gene frequency in populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Kind of Tissue Involved and Type of Inheritance**:\n",
      "   - Somatic Mutations: Occur in somatic tissue and are not passed on to progeny.\n",
      "   - Germinal (or Germ-Line) Mutations: Occur in reproductive cells and can be inherited by future generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Impact on Fitness or Function**:\n",
      "   - Deleterious Mutations: Harmful and decrease the fitness of the individual.\n",
      "   - Advantageous Mutations: Beneficial and increase the fitness of the individual.\n",
      "   - Neutral Mutations: Neither beneficial nor harmful.\n",
      "   - Lethal Mutations: Lead to the death of the organism.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Molecular Structure and Scale of the Mutation**:\n",
      "   - Point Mutations: Affect a single gene or a few base pairs (substitutions, insertions, deletions).\n",
      "   - Chromosomal Mutations: Affect the structure of chromosomes (deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Effect on Gene Function**:\n",
      "   - Loss-of-Function Mutations: Result in a gene product that has reduced or no function.\n",
